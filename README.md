## Description

The inspiration for Prime Toys is based upon the following user Story:

> <span style="font-style:italic">AS a user for Prime Toys</span>
> 
> <span style="font-style:italic">I WANT to be able list and trade my toys</span>
>
> <span style="font-style:italic">SO THAT I can give away or receive something I prefer</span>

The application operates similar to an old school barter system, where users with unwanted toys can post their unwanted goods for free or up for trade. Other users can then view all listings made to the site and can offer up their own listings for trade. The main upcoming of the program is to support wasteless mindset, using a niche trading scheme.

The application is designed to be user friendly with intuitive features that simple to follow. It is also built to be mobile responsive with semantic feature.

## Third Party Libraries

Apollo-server-express, bcrypt, graphql, jwt, mongoose, express, apollo/client, redux, formik, react and sass.

## Installation

To install this program all you need is a text editor. I would recommend Visual Studio Code, then download or clone the repository of the program. Finally install the required npm packages and run the app.

## Demonstration

The user will be required to create a new account to access majority of the application's features. Without an account, users can still view the listings of other users, but will not be able to make a trade offer.

When an account is created, the user will be prompted to their profile page, where users can view their own listings and have the option to add/remove/update their toys.

Back to the listings page, users can view the all other listings made by other users and have the option to view additional details and make a trade offer simply by clicking their respective buttons.

Finally on the homepage, users are presented with a brief overview on how our site works as well as a list of recent listings.
